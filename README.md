A Windows Phone 8.1 App to learn norwegian vocabulary. (Still in construction)
It is a project for educational use only and might contain errors or bugs.

The app is stored as an Windows Universal App but at the moment just the WinPhone part is developed and the other part might be used for later implementations.
